In this module there are three main functions:
1. The welcome_new_player, that allows us to create a new player in the game.
2. The day_count that allows us to follow the pass of the days
3. The end of the day function that closes the day

      3. Type of pet chosen
      4. Name of pet
      5. Name of the farm chosen
      All this information will be saved in the dictionary called <player_information>. The player will be informed as well that these initial values

      These are the default values set up by the system. All of them are also saved into the dictionary <player_information>
