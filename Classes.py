'''
This class will allow to create multiple players with their default settings. It's an improvement from the 
previous method that worked only with dictionaries. The properties that the player will have, so far, are:

    1. Player name
    2. Type farm chosen
    3. Farm name
    4. Pet type
    5. Pet name

Some default values are setted as well:
    1. Current location, that will equal to type farm chosen at the very begining
    2. Hp = 100
    3. Energy = 100
    4. Money = 0

This class will be updated with methods that the player can execute further on. So far, it's not implemented in the code. 
It will be implemented later on. But this is a start.
